## How It Works

1. **Content Script** (`content.js`) runs on Netacad pages and detects quiz elements using Shadow DOM
2. Netacad uses Shadow DOM to encapsulate quiz content, so the script accesses the `mcq-view` element's shadow root
3. The script extracts question text and options from inside the shadow DOM
4. User clicks either the **blue button** (GPT) or **purple button** (Gemini)
5. **Background Script** (`background.js`) sends the question to the selected AI provider (OpenAI or Google)
6. The AI responds with only the correct option letter (A, B, C, or D)
7. The extension highlights the corresponding option with inline styles (since CSS doesn't penetrate Shadow DOM)

## Privacy & Security

- API keys are stored locally in Chrome's sync storage
- No data is sent to any server except the AI provider you choose (OpenAI or Google)
- The extension only runs on `netacad.com` domains
- Your quiz data is only sent to the AI provider when you click a button

## Limitations

- AI suggestions may not always be correct - always verify answers
- Requires at least one API key (OpenAI or Gemini)
- **Affordable/FREE options**:
  - **Gemini**: Free tier with generous limits (⭐ Recommended to start)
  - **OpenAI**: Very affordable pay-as-you-go pricing
- Only works on multiple-choice questions
- Both models work well for all question types

## Troubleshooting

**Extension buttons not appearing**
- Make sure you're on a Netacad quiz page with multiple choice questions
- Refresh the page after installing the extension
- Check that both blue (GPT) and purple (Gemini) buttons are visible

**API errors**
- Verify your API key is correct in the extension popup
- For GPT button: Make sure you entered a valid OpenAI API key
- For Gemini button: Make sure you entered a valid Google Gemini API key
- Check that you have API credits/quota remaining
- Gemini has a generous free tier - start with that if you're unsure

**No answer highlighted**
- Check the browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify the question format is supported (must be multiple choice)
- Try the other provider button if one doesn't work
- Make sure you saved your API key(s) in the settings
